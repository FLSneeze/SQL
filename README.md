SQL Portfolio

## Greetings! This is my SQL portfolio, showcasing some of the SQL code that I have written. Please feel free to peruse through it and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any inquiries. If you wish to stylize the text in a specific way, kindly refer to the formatting guide available in this documentation. For a preview of your formatting, click on the Preview tab at the top of the workbook. Check out the accompanying screenshots to see how I styled mine and the final outcome.
